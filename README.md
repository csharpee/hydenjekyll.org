# Summary
This web application is the core website for HydenJekyll.org. It is a live JAMstack (Jekyll, API's, Markup) of a website with *micro services* that includes all the bells and whistles for comments, content management systems (CMS), site generators, blog posts, git version management, progressive web applications (PWA), and much more.

Our stack architecture reflects minimal need for Javascript, Php and Sql and preserves the speedy *reactivity* of the modern web architecture.

Our architecture trumps in security, file size and modularity, while expediting sonic load times and reducing the learning curve for web developers and editors alike!

We focus on quality *design* and *content*; while creating increased portability, automated testing, speedy load times and secure lightweight web apps.

No proprietary operating system dependencies required, only Docker Engine super machines and some tender love and care (TLC).
